# project 2

## Scenario

We did some copy and pasting and ending creating resources with the name of "example".

We want to rename the resources from from "example" to "dev".

Unfortunately if we do this and then try to plan we see that Terraform will have to recreate the resources.

Can you think of a way for us to rename the resource to "dev" without having to recreate all the resources?

## Solution

- Update the project
- Add any command line instructions to this README.md

Important: do not reference the command documentation, we want to see actual usage and referencing our resources i.e. if you need to use the "plan" command we would expect "terraform plan" not a link to https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/plan
