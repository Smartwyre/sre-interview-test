# project 3

## Scenario

You've take over an existing infrastructure environment. Everyone is keen that we don't lose our existing infrastructure.

## Solution

Important: you can assume that the suffix is a fixed string i.e. the random_id resource is no longer needed

Recall your solution for [project1](../project1/main.tf), use it to migrate the existing infrastructure created by project1.

- Update the project
- Add any command line instructions to this README.md

Important: do not reference the command documentation, we want to see actual usage and referencing our resources i.e. if you need to use the "plan" command we would expect "terraform plan" not a link to https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/plan
