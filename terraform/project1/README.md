# project 1

## Scenario

You've been asked to review this project. Can you provide any feedback?

- Is this a good solution?
- Will it scale? i.e. what will happen as you continue to add new environments or resources

## Solution

You can assume this project has never been run, so there is no migration strategy required.

- Update the project
- Add any command line instructions to this README.md

Important: do not reference the command documentation, we want to see actual usage and referencing our resources i.e. if you need to use the "plan" command we would expect "terraform plan" not a link to https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/plan
