# SRE interview repo

This take-home test will allow us to assess your experience with some of the technology we use. 

These tests should only take you 1-2 hours to complete.

## Instructions

Each folder will have instructions on what you need to achieve.

Please upload your answer to GitHub in your project and send the link via email.

Even if you don't complete all of the exercises, you should still submit your answers.

## Important

- do not try to complete this test during the interview - you will not have enough time.
- send your answers two days before your interview.
